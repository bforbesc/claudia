Hey — this is where I keep my Claude Code setup. Skills, plugins, config, the whole thing.

I update it as I go. It's my source of truth, but feel free to steal whatever's useful. Enjoy.

## Applying Config

```bash
# Copy global instructions and settings
cp config/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
cp config/settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json

# Copy custom skills
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

> Plugins are fetched from the marketplace — reinstall them via Claude Code rather than copying the cache.
> Use `plugins/installed_plugins.json` as the reference list.

## Active Hooks

| Event | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `PreToolUse → Bash` | Any `git commit` command | Runs `/check` skill to catch bugs before committing |
| `PostToolUse → AskUserQuestion` | Claude asks a question | Speaks `"Need your input"` aloud |
| `Stop` | Claude finishes a response | Speaks `"Completed..."` aloud |

---

## Custom Skills (`skills/`)

Invoke with `/skill-name` in any Claude Code session.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `check` | Reviews staged/unstaged changes for bugs, broken references, and runtime errors before committing. Ignores style. |
| `handoff` | Switches accounts while preserving conversation context, or produces a context block to continue in a new session. |
| `pr` | Stages changes, commits, pushes, and opens a new PR or adds a follow-up comment to an existing one. |
| `pr-comments` | Fetches all comments and reviews on the current PR, summarizes them, and recommends which to address. |
| `resolve-conflicts` | Summarizes merge conflicts, resolves unambiguous ones automatically, and asks about ambiguous ones. |
| `switch` | Switches Claude Code to a different account (logout → login) without passing context. |

---

## Plugins (`plugins/`)

Marketplace plugins from `claude-plugins-official`. Each adds skills, agents, commands, or hooks.

| `claude-md-management` | `claude-md-improver` skill + `/revise-claude-md` command — audits and improves CLAUDE.md files |

| `code-simplifier` | `code-simplifier` agent — simplifies recently changed code for clarity and maintainability |
| `commit-commands` | `/commit`, `/commit-push-pr`, `/clean_gone` — git workflow shortcuts |
| `context7` | Live documentation fetching for any library, framework, or SDK via MCP |
| `explanatory-output-style` | SessionStart hook that enables educational insight mode with `★ Insight` blocks |
